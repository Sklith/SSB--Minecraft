// I will continue to put items in here as I get them done. Once the arena code is done, we can work on a system to get these items to spawn in the map! :D
// Not sure if this class is in the right place, maybe it should be moved to it's own package.
// I'm still unsure how to use github completly, so bare with me, I will fuigure it out soon enough!
