Super Smash Brothers: Minecraft, or SSB: Minecraft, or even just SSBM, is a Bukkit plugin created to mimic the SMASH gamemode from the Shotbow Network. The plugin is being developed in 1.6.4, and will be updated once a recommended build of 1.7.2/1.7.4 comes out from Bukkit. The plugin will have as many features as possible, and will be as customizable as possible. Currently, the project is not for public release. You may view the source code and see how we're progressing. We cannot reliably predict a release date for the plugin. If you want to lend a hand, you can private message Incomprehendable or AwesomeMin3r2000 on BukkitDev, however, we currently do not need any extra personnel, if you have a change that you think would be useful, create a pull request with your change.

Thank you. <br />
